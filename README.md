Artificial Neural Networks Practicals Repository

Welcome to the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Practicals Repository! 
This repository includes practical exercises and projects completed during my college coursework focused on ANN concepts and implementations. 
Each folder contains code, datasets, and documentation that demonstrate various neural network architectures, training methods, and evaluation techniques.

The practicals cover essential topics such as feedforward networks, backpropagation, regularization techniques, and performance metrics. This repository serves as a valuable resource showcasing my hands-on experience in ANN and deep learning.
